Deep-Learning-Over-Graphlab
===========================

This is authored by Sai Sagar Jinka. I tailored the Graphlab to suit for deep learning.

I can't provide the full code in the folder. But this is the description of the APIs I have designed for the task. Using this APIs 
I did RBMs, ANNs and also DNNs. 

Positive means going through Forward Direction. User can write his algorithm for forward pass here.

Negative function goes through backward Direction. User can write backward algorithmin this one.
